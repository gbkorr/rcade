\format{
A game \link[=rom.init]{ROM}; see \code{vignette("engine")}.
}
\usage{
R2Studio
}
\description{
RStudio in RStudio! Type R code into the input session to execute it in a simulated R console.

See \code{vignette("r2studio")} for details on the ROM's inner workings.
}
\details{
To start, run \code{quickload(R2Studio)} and start the input session with \code{inputs.listen()} in a separate RStudio window (as usual).

Now, any text entered in the input session will be interpreted as R code in the R\eqn{^2}Studio console. You should be able to run text-based code as you would in the regular IDE!
}
\section{Plotting}{

Entering a \code{plot} command will draw the plot inside the game display. All other plotting commands are unsupported.

R\eqn{^2}Studio's scatterplots respect several parameters from \code{base::plot()}:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{x
y
xlim
ylim
main
pch
cex
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}
}

\section{Settings}{

The appearance of the console can be changed with a couple commands (entered in the input session like any other code for R\eqn{^2}Studio).

\code{use.size(width = NULL, height = NULL, plot.width = NULL)}: resize display or plot window

\code{use.font(font = NULL, kerning = NULL, linespacing = NULL, darkmode = NULL)}: change or edit console font
}
