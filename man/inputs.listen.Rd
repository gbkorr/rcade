\usage{
inputs.listen()

inputs.read()
}
\description{
\code{inputs.listen()} listens for input and writes all entered text into the \code{inputs.csv} file in the \link[tools:userdir]{package directory}.

\code{inputs.listen()} should be run in a \strong{separate RStudio instance} from where the game is running. This allows the game to read player input without interruption.

\code{inputs.read()} reads this \code{inputs.csv} file; it is called in the \link[=ram.update]{main gameloop} to retrieve live player input.

Each input is only submitted when the \code{Enter} key is pressed. This can make interacting with the game initially challenging.
}
\details{
An 'input' is a string of text with a timestamp corresponding to when the game should \link[=inputs.process]{process} the input.

Inputs are stored as rows in the \code{inputs.csv} dataframe, which has the following columns:\tabular{lll}{
    \tab  \tab  \cr
   \code{timestamp} \tab \verb{  } \tab \code{\link[=time.sec]{time.sec()}} at which the input was entered plus a small delay (see arguments). \cr
    \tab  \tab  \cr
   \code{text} \tab  \tab String that was entered at this timestamp. Each character will be parsed by the game as an individual key input. \cr
}


\code{inputs.listen()} adds a new row to \code{inputs.csv} each time \code{Enter} is pressed.
}
\section{inputs.csv}{

\code{inputs.csv} is stored in \code{\link[tools:userdir]{tools::R_user_dir('rcade')}}, the directory for storing package data.

Only one \code{inputs.csv} file exists and is read by the package; the file is wiped every time \code{\link[=ram.init]{ram.init()}} is called.
}

\seealso{
\code{vignette("inputs")} gives an overview of each part of the input system.

\link[=inputs.process]{?inputs.process} provides a more focused description of how an input gets from the player's keyboard to the game code.
