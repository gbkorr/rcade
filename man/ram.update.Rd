\usage{
ram.update(RAM)
}
\arguments{
\item{RAM}{\href{ram.init}{RAM} object to update.}
}
\description{
Ticks RAM, draws RAM, and syncs time with the framerate.\cr This function is looped infinitely by \code{\link[=ram.run]{ram.run()}}; it should not be used alone.
}
\details{
If the RAM is behind the current frame (lagging) (\verb{RAM\%time < }\code{\link[=time.sec]{time.sec()}}):
\itemize{
\item drawing is skipped
\item \code{ram.update()} is called again with no delay
}

If the RAM is ahead of the current frame (caught up):
\itemize{
\item \code{\link[=render.ram]{render.ram()}} is called to draw the game
\item the game sleeps until the next frame
}

This tries to keep the RAM on the current frame, such that it will always be ahead (and have time to draw).\cr
When the RAM is behind the current frame, the game update process speeds up and runs the game as fast as possible without any drawing to get it back to the current time.\cr

Since drawing is by far the slowest part of the gameloop, this allows it to recover and catch up to the present very quickly after time is rewound in a \link[=ram.rollback]{rollback}.
