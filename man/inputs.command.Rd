\description{
Allow the user to interact with the RAM from the listening session by inputting \verb{/[command]} during listening.

See \code{vignette("rrio")} to see these in action.
}
\details{
These commands are generally useful to debugging or testing parts of a game that are difficult to test at full speed. Alternatively, greater control can be achieved by using the display session and manually interacting with the game with:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{RAM = ram.input(RAM, [input])
RAM = ram.tick(RAM)
render.ram(RAM)
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

Which also allows the user to copy and restore RAMs as savestates, etc.

\tabular{lll}{
    \tab  \tab  \cr
   \verb{/pause} \tab  \tab Pauses the RAM without stopping the gameloop. \cr
    \tab  \tab  \cr
   \verb{/resume} \tab  \tab Resumes the game if paused. \cr
    \tab  \tab  \cr
   \verb{/tick} \tab  \tab Iterates the RAM one tick, as if \code{ram.tick()} had been called in the display session. \cr
    \tab  \tab  \cr
   \verb{/rollback} \tab \verb{} \tab Forces a rollback, and draws if the game is paused. \cr
}


If the game is paused and an input is entered, it will be processed next \verb{/tick} or when the game resumes. This allows the player to play a game frame-by-frame.
