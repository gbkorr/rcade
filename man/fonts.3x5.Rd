\title{3x5 Font}
\format{
A \link[=render.makefont]{font}; a list containing font-related properties and a list of sprites for each character.
}
\usage{
fonts.3x5
}
\description{
Basic \link[=render.makefont]{font} with all common characters. Horizontally compact, but much more readable than \link{fonts.3x3}. This should be the preferred low-res font for most situations.

Made by yours truly. Some of these sprites are pretty snazzy.

Use this with \code{\link[=render.text]{render.text()}}.
