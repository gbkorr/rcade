\description{
\link{YOU NEED TO ACTUALLY WRITE THIS FUNCTION} (print out details about debug, e.g. riollback frequency, average times, et.c)
This function prints it all, but it's recommended to plot separately (see examples).
}
\details{
This function prints out some timing-related debug information.

\code{RAM$debug} contains a host of data from the RAM's recent gameplay, relevant to the timing and rollback systems (\code{vignette("timing")} and \code{vignette("rollback")}). This is mostly useful for internal debugging (i.e. by the package dev), especially for online play.

\section{RAM$debug}{

\code{RAM$debug} contains the following elements:\tabular{lll}{
    \tab  \tab  \cr
    \tab  \tab  \cr
   \code{time} \tab  \tab For each frame, \code{\link[=time.sec]{time.sec()}} at the start of the frame. Useful as an x-axis for plotting other elements. \cr
    \tab  \tab  \cr
   \code{ahead} \tab  \tab At the end of each frame, how far ahead the RAM is from the end of this frame; (\code{RAM$time - time.sec()}). If this is negative, the RAM is lagging behind. \cr
    \tab  \tab  \cr
   \code{input.behind} \tab \verb{  } \tab For any inputs received on this frame, time between their timestamp and RAM$time \cr
    \tab  \tab  \cr
   \code{time.tick} \tab  \tab For each frame, time it took to run \code{\link[=ram.tick]{ram.tick()}}. \cr
    \tab  \tab  \cr
   \code{time.draw} \tab  \tab For each frame, time it took to run \code{\link[=render.ram]{render.ram()}}. \cr
    \tab  \tab  \cr
   \code{time.inputs} \tab  \tab For each frame, time it took to run \code{\link[=inputs.get]{inputs.get()}} and \code{\link[=inputs.process]{inputs.process()}}. \cr
    \tab  \tab  \cr
   \code{rollbacks} \tab  \tab For each occurrence of a rollback (\code{\link[=ram.rollback]{ram.rollback()}} call), records the \code{\link[=time.sec]{time.sec()}} at which it happened. \cr
    \tab  \tab  \cr
   \code{frames} \tab  \tab For each frame, the value of \code{RAM$ticks}; the current tick the RAM is at. Makes rollbacks a more obvious than buffer. \cr
    \tab  \tab  \cr
   \code{frames.drawn} \tab  \tab Records every frame of \code{RAM$ticks} that was drawn by \code{\link[=render.ram]{render.ram()}}, i.e. when \code{ahead} was positive (see \code{vignette("timing")}). \cr
