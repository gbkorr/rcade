\description{
A ROM that plays the video \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtutLA63Cp8}{Bad Apple}.\cr
See \code{vignette("badapple")} for more details.

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{RAM = ram.init(BadApple); RAM = ram.run(RAM)
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

You may have to zoom out a bit with \verb{cmd -}.

\code{BadApple.data} stores the compressed video frames, which are decompressed in \code{BadApple$startup()}.

\details{
This is a proof of concept for rendering video in rcade. It's actually easier to render video by reading from a local file, but to fit a video to come preinstalled with the package, I had to compress it.

\code{BadApple$startup()} reconstructs the video when the RAM is initialized, saving the resultant frames as a single animation in \code{RAM$ROM$sprites}. A single object then loops the animation constantly.

The frames are from \url{https://github.com/Timendus/chip-8-bad-apple}.
}
\section{Compression}{

\code{BadApple.data} is an ordered list of vectors, with each vector corresponding to a frame. Each vector stores the indices of which pixels should flip (\verb{black <-> white}) compared the previous frame; this allows the video to be iteratively reconstructed losslessly starting from a blank frame.

Much stronger forms of compression have been devised for Bad Apple projects, but this is a simple, naive approach that works well enough (50 -> 1MB) for the application. More importantly, rcade shouldn't really require compressed videos since you can read frames directly from a file.
