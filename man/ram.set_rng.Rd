\title{Set RAM RNG}
\usage{
ram.set_rng(RAM, seed)
}
\arguments{
\item{RAM}{\href{ram.init}{RAM} object.}

\item{seed}{Integer used for \link[base:Random]{base::set.seed}.}
}
\description{
Sets the RAM's RNG with \code{\link[base:Random]{base::set.seed()}}. This is useful in \code{ROM$startup} if a dev wants their game to always use the same RNG seed, etc.
}
\details{
R's RNG is based on the .Random.seed global variable, which updates when a random call or set.seed() is called. RAM stores its own copy of this variable and temporarily restores it before running game code. Thus RNG ends up working as expected within a game, and will produce the same random calls when the game rolls back.

Additionally, the RAM restores the R session's RNG after running game code, so the user's R environment is unaffected by random calls in the game.
