\description{
Unexpected crash? This documentation provides debugging resources and lists some common problems you might encounter.

The Snake vignette is goes through the basic development process and is very useful; you can view it with \code{vignette("Snake")}.
}
\section{Traceback}{

When the game crashes, it prints a \verb{traceback, call, and error}:\tabular{lll}{
    \tab  \tab  \cr
   Traceback \tab \verb{  } \tab A list showing which functions led to where the error is. Should be similar to what you get from base R's \code{\link[=traceback]{traceback()}}. \cr
   Call \tab  \tab The call in which the error occurred. \cr
   Error \tab  \tab The specific error. \cr
}


\code{\link[=ram.run]{?ram.run}} has a function tree of that may be useful in understanding where an error occurred; the traceback will list the branches encompassing the error call.
}

\section{Logging}{

Multiple options exist for printing information via game code.
\itemize{
\item The contents of \code{RAM$echo} are printed below the game render every frame.
\item Any \code{base::print()} calls will only be visible \emph{if the game crashes} due to how the console is wiped.
\item A global variable \verb{foo <<- [debug info]} can be modified via the game code.
}

Thus \code{print()} is ideal for debugging the source of a crash, as it prints information about the current tick. \code{RAM$echo} is useful for monitoring values while running the game, and using a global variable gives more control and the option to record info for every tick.
}

\section{Timing}{

\link[=ram.debug]{RAM$debug} records a lot of timing-related data relevant to the timing and rollback systems (\code{vignette("timing")} and \code{vignette("rollback")}).
}

\section{Empty Lists}{

Make sure you haven't accidentally wiped RAM or \code{RAM$objects}. This can happen if you define a custom function like \code{ROM$my_function(RAM)} and forget to return RAM at the end of it.
}

\section{Inputs}{

Make sure that \code{tools::R_user_dir("rcade")} exists.

Double-check \code{ROM$keybinds} and make sure \code{RAM$actions} are properly referenced in your code. Consider adding \code{RAM$echo = RAM$actions} to \code{ROM$custom} to show the state of each action every tick.
}

\section{Iterating}{

To iterate through \code{RAM$objects}, use the syntax

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{for (i in 1:length(RAM$objects))\{
	obj = RAM$objects[[i]]

\}
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

This is required due to how R handles nested lists; the format\cr \verb{for (obj in RAM$objects)} will \strong{NOT} work.
