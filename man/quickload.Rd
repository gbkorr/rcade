\title{Play a Game}
\usage{
quickload(ROM)
}
\arguments{
\item{ROM}{\link[=rom.init]{ROM} to play.}
}
\description{
Starts a game immediately using a ROM.
}
\details{
Convenience wrapper for the code:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{RAM = ram.init(ROM)
RAM = ram.run(RAM)
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

This saves RAM in the environment in which \code{quickload()} was called, so the RAM can be accessed afterwards as if it were run manually.

quickload(Snake)
