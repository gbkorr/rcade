\title{Render a Matrix to the Console}
\usage{
render.matrix(M, clear_console = FALSE, palette = c("  ", "[]", "  "))
}
\arguments{
\item{M}{Matrix to be drawn. Should contain only nonegative integers, corresponding to the desired characters to be drawn as defined by \code{palette}.}

\item{clear_console}{Wipes the console with \code{cat('\\f')} before printing. This keeps the render in a consistent position.}

\item{palette}{An ordered vector of which character to draw when an element of M = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.}
}
\description{
Prints a matrix as pixels: characters coded by the matrix.\cr
By default, this prints in black&white with black pixels represented as \verb{[]}:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{    []
  []  []
[]      []
  [][][]
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}
}
\section{Default Palette}{

The default matrix-to-character encoding (palette) is as follows:

\verb{0:}\verb{    }\verb{: transparent}\cr
\verb{1:}\verb{ [] }\verb{: black}\cr
\verb{2:}\verb{    }\verb{: white}

White and Transparent are usually printed identically, but their behavior differs elsewhere in the package. (i.e. when matrices are overlaid with \code{\link[=render.overlay]{render.overlay()}})

smiley = matrix(c(0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0), ncol = 7)
