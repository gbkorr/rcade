inputs.process(RAM)
}
\arguments{
\item{RAM}{\href{ram.init}{RAM} object to update.}
}
\description{
Updates \code{RAM$actions} according to any inputs occurring on the current frame.

Inputs and actions are stored in RAM like so:\tabular{lll}{
    \tab  \tab  \cr
   \code{RAM$inputs} \tab \verb{  } \tab Stores every input that ever occurred, just like \href{inputs.read}{\code{inputs.csv}}. \cr
    \tab  \tab  \cr
   \code{RAM$actions} \tab  \tab Stores the game actions corresponding to inputs as dictated in \code{ROM$keybinds} (see below). \cr
}
}
\details{
The following is an outline of the process from a player entering an input to it being registered by the game.
\enumerate{
\item Player types out "wa" in the \code{\link[=inputs.listen]{inputs.listen()}} listener.\cr
\item Player presses Enter; an input is created consisting of the string \code{"wa"} and a timestamp (see \link{inputs.listen}).\cr
This input is written to \href{inputs.read}{\code{inputs.csv}}.\cr
\item When the gameloop runs \code{\link[=inputs.convert]{inputs.convert()}}, this input is added to \code{RAM$inputs} and its timestamp is converted to the tick it should be processed on.\cr
\item When \verb{RAM$ticks ==} the tick timestamp of this input in \code{RAM$inputs}, the input is processed:\cr
\item The input is split into individual characters: \code{"w"} and \code{"a"}.\cr
\item The actions corresponding to these keys, \verb{RAM$ROM$keybinds["w"] and RAM$ROM$keybinds["a"]}, are set to \code{TRUE} in \code{RAM$actions} (see below).\cr
\item Game code in \code{RAM$ROM$custom()} reads \code{RAM$actions} and move the player character accordingly.
\item On the next frame, all \code{RAM$actions} are set to FALSE before inputs are checked again.

\section{Keybinds}{

Keybinds are set by the dev with, e.g.

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{ROM$keybinds = c(k = 'attack', w = 'up', a = 'left', s = 'down', d = 'right')
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

This stores the actions ('attack', 'up', etc.) and the keys (k, w, etc.) that, when input, activate the actions.
These keybinds populate \code{RAM$actions} when RAM is \href{ram.init}{initialized}:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{RAM$actions = c(attack = FALSE, up = FALSE, left = FALSE, down = FALSE. right = FALSE)
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

When a key is registered, the corresponding action in \code{RAM$actions} is set to TRUE for one frame.

The game should read RAM$actions to control game behavior; see \code{vignette('rrio')} to see this in action.
