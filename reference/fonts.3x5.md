# 3x5 Font

Basic
[font](https://gbkorr.github.io/rcade/reference/render.makefont.md) with
all common characters. Horizontally compact, but much more readable than
[fonts.3x3](https://gbkorr.github.io/rcade/reference/fonts.3x3.md). This
should be the preferred low-res font for most situations.

Made by yours truly. Some of these sprites are pretty snazzy.

Use this with
[`render.text()`](https://gbkorr.github.io/rcade/reference/render.text.md).

## Usage

``` r
fonts.3x5
```

## Format

A [font](https://gbkorr.github.io/rcade/reference/render.makefont.md); a
list containing font-related properties and a list of sprites for each
character.
